The website is built using plain HTML and CSS.
It consists of four main sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contacts.
Clicking on any of these sections smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding area.
The provided images are appropriately incorporated throughout the design.
Flexbox and positioning CSS properties are applied for layout structure.
The site is responsive, adapting to mobile screens.
A responsive menu is created using a combination of JavaScript and CSS for smaller screens.
Images are loaded lazily to improve performance.
The webpage includes a loading animation that fades out once the site has fully loaded, implemented using CSS keyframes.
